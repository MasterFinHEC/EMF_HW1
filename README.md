# EMF_HW1
The Main code is "HW1_Final" and it calls all the other code in the folder.

You need to create three folders in order to store the results, the plots and the latex code for the table: 

Results 

Plots

Latex_Table 

If you don't want any plots or latex code, you can only create the Results folder and delete the two last line of HW1_Final (The lines calling the plot and latex codes).
